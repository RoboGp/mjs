Introduction
Task I) Develop a localisation system that takes the robot from a random initial place in the arena to a specific target location.

Clarity of presentation of results, solution's creativity, completeness of the overall approach taken, etc.
   
Do talk about any sensor/actuator modelling, robot design issues, challenges faced, etc.
Do include images/diagrams illustrating how your approach works.

*IMPORTANT: On the front cover you must include:
