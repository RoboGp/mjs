=========
Shifted the ultra scan readings by 1.
Using the mean of two scans.

Likelihood - dividing by the abs(difference of shifted(p) and scanned(r) readings)

weights == sum of likelihood.
[Higher the difference, Lesser the weight]

Testing correct shift - averaging between -1 & -2


No movement + Weight distribution test
==============
Lower std seems to help == 8 (better than 10)

Placed robot near a corner of the arena - the particle at the corner of the map should have had similar readings 
[very close to 2 of the arena walls]
Readings along diagonals seem to mess up the right particle's likelihood of having the highest weight.


normpdf is making a huge difference. Works well with std dev == 8.

Best particle estimation - pick the best out of the neighbourhood having more nuber of particles.

Amongst the top 'x' best particles, pick the estimate with the highest number of particles in its neighbourhood or highest sum(weight)
